## üß∞ Platform support

This plugin includes prepackaged Gitleaks binaries:

| Platform | Architecture | Included Binary |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Windows 10/11 | x64 | ‚úÖ |
| macOS Intel | x64 | ‚úÖ |
| macOS Apple Silicon | arm64 | ‚úÖ |
| Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) | x64 | ‚úÖ |

*(Linux ARM64 support can be added by dropping the binary in `bin/linux-arm64/gitleaks`.)*

You don‚Äôt need to install Gitleaks manually ‚Äî the plugin automatically extracts and runs the correct binary.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. Open or edit any file in your Eclipse workspace.  
2. When you save the file, the plugin automatically:
   - Runs the bundled Gitleaks scanner on that file.
   - Generates a temporary JSON report.
   - Shows a popup only if secrets are detected.

Example popup:

```
Gitleaks Results
File: /path/to/config.json

Secrets detected (2):

1. aws-access-key ‚Äî Generic AWS Key
   at /path/to/config.json:14
   match: AKIA********************

2. slack-token ‚Äî Slack Bot Token
   at /path/to/config.json:27
   match: xoxb-1234...
```

If no findings are detected ‚Üí no popup.

## üß© How it works (for maintainers)

- The `SaveListener` class listens for Eclipse resource change events (`POST_CHANGE`).  
- When a file is saved:
  - The listener refreshes the resource to ensure the latest state.
  - The bundled Gitleaks binary (found via `GitleaksLocator`) runs with:
    ```bash
    gitleaks detect --no-git --exit-code=0 --no-banner -v \
      --report-format json \
      --report-path /tmp/report.json \
      --source=<saved-file>
    ```
  - JSON output is parsed and shown in a dialog.

- Binaries are located under `bin/<platform>/gitleaks`, packed into the plugin JAR, and extracted automatically at runtime.

## üõ†Ô∏è Updating Gitleaks

To update to a new version:

1. Download the latest binaries from [Gitleaks releases](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases).  
2. Extract only the `gitleaks` or `gitleaks.exe` file.
3. Replace the old binaries in:
   ```
   bin/windows-x64/gitleaks.exe
   bin/macos-x64/gitleaks
   bin/macos-arm64/gitleaks
   bin/linux-x64/gitleaks
   ```
4. Rebuild or export the plugin.

## ‚öñÔ∏è License

This plugin and the bundled [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) binaries are licensed under the MIT License.  
Include the Gitleaks license file in your distribution if you redistribute the binary.

## üß™ Troubleshooting

- **No popup appears?**  
  Ensure your file was modified and saved. Only files with content changes trigger a scan.

- **Permission denied on macOS/Linux?**  
  The plugin automatically marks the binary executable, but on restrictive systems you may need to run Eclipse once with `sudo` or adjust file permissions.
