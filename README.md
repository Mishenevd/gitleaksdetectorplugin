# 🧩 Gitleaks Detector Plugin for Eclipse

Gitleaks Detector automatically scans your files for secrets (tokens, keys, passwords, etc.) whenever you save a file in Eclipse.  
It integrates the [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) CLI directly into your workspace — no external installation required.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic scanning: Runs Gitleaks every time you save a file.  
- Instant feedback: Displays a popup if potential secrets are detected.  
- Self-contained: Bundles the Gitleaks binary for all major platforms — works out of the box.  
- Lightweight: No background jobs or manual setup required.

## 🧰 Platform support

This plugin includes prepackaged Gitleaks binaries:

| Platform | Architecture | Included Binary |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Windows 10/11 | x64 | ✅ |
| macOS Intel | x64 | ✅ |
| macOS Apple Silicon | arm64 | ✅ |
| Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) | x64 | ✅ |

*(Linux ARM64 support can be added by dropping the binary in bin/linux-arm64/gitleaks.)*

You don’t need to install Gitleaks manually — the plugin will automatically extract and run the correct binary.

## ⚙️ Usage

1. Open or edit any file in your Eclipse workspace.  
2. When you save the file, the plugin automatically:
   - Runs the bundled Gitleaks scanner on that file.
   - Generates a temporary JSON report.
   - Shows a popup only if secrets are detected.

Example popup:
Gitleaks Results
File: /path/to/config.json

Secrets detected (2):

1. aws-access-key — Generic AWS Key
   at /path/to/config.json:14
   match: AKIA********************

2. slack-token — Slack Bot Token
   at /path/to/config.json:27
   match: xoxb-1234...
...No findings → no popup.

## 🧩 How it works (for maintainers)

- The class SaveListener listens for Eclipse resource change events (`POST_CHANGE`).
- When a file is saved:
  - The listener refreshes the resource to ensure the latest state.
  - The bundled Gitleaks binary (found via `GitleaksLocator`) runs with:
gitleaks detect --no-git --exit-code=0 --no-banner -v \
      --report-format json \
      --report-path /tmp/report.json \
      --source=<saved-file>
- JSON output is parsed and shown in a dialog.

- Binaries are located under bin/<platform>/gitleaks, packed into the plugin JAR, and extracted automatically at runtime.

## 🛠️ Updating Gitleaks

To update to a new version:

1. Download the latest binaries from [Gitleaks releases](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases).  
2. Extract only the gitleaks or gitleaks.exe file.
3. Replace the old binaries in:
bin/windows-x64/gitleaks.exe
   bin/macos-x64/gitleaks
   bin/macos-arm64/gitleaks
   bin/linux-x64/gitleaks
4. Rebuild or export the plugin.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- No popup appears?  
  Ensure your file was modified and saved. Only files with content changes trigger a scan.


- Permission denied on macOS/Linux?  
  The plugin automatically marks the binary executable, but on restrictive systems you may need to run Eclipse once with sudo or adjust file permissions.

- Gitleaks not found?  
  Verify that the bin/ directory and platform folders are included in build.properties.
